SysInfoLogger is an open-source tool designed for use in a virtual machine (VM) environment to simulate the information that malicious software might extract from your system. This tool aims to educate users about the types of data that could be accessed by a computer virus, helping improve awareness and security practices.

---

## Features

- Detects and displays key system information, including:
  - Windows OS version
  - Mouse and input devices
  - Connected and previously connected devices
  - Computer name and username
  - Router's private IP address
  - Public IP address (geo-location inferred if available)
- Automatically downloads `curl` if not pre-installed (optional prerequisite).
- Compiled version available as `.exe` for users without AutoHotkey v1 installed.
- Completely transparent and open-source for educational and testing purposes.

---

## Prerequisites

- **curl**: Required for retrieving the public IP address and other web-based data. The program will prompt to download it if absent.

---

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the script manually:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/SysInfoLogger.git
   ```

2. Ensure AutoHotkey v1 is installed, or use the compiled `.exe` version.

3. Extract the `.exe` or `.ahk` file anywhere on your desktop or in a folder.

4. Run the file in a secure environment (preferably a virtual machine).

## Output

Shortly after running, the program will display detailed system information in a format similar to the image below, which shows an example output with sensitive information blanked out:
